        <p>
            Hello! My name is Lucky and I am from Delta State, Nigeria. I am passionate about
            technology, creativity, and continuous learning.
            Over the years, I have developed a strong interest in web development because it allows
            me to combine problem-solving with design,
            creating solutions that can reach people all over the world. I enjoy experimenting with
            new tools, exploring modern frameworks,
            and building projects that challenge me to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond coding, I love connecting with people, sharing ideas, and collaborating on
            meaningful projects. I believe that technology
            is not just about writing code, but about improving lives and making information more
            accessible. My goal in this course is to
            strengthen my foundation in web development, gain hands-on experience, and prepare
            myself for bigger opportunities in the tech industry.
            I am excited to learn, practice, and showcase my progress through each assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I am not coding, I enjoy reading, exploring creative designs, and spending time
            outdoors. I believe balance is important,
            and I try to bring that same energy into my work. This course is an exciting opportunity
            for me to grow my skills and connect
            with others who share similar interests. I look forward to the journey ahead!
